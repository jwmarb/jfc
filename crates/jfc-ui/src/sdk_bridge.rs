//! Thin bridge between jfc-ui and the `jfc-anthropic-sdk` crate.

//! Mostly a single source of truth for constructing an SDK `Client` from
//! whatever credentials the user has configured (env, OAuth, vault),
//! plus opt-in helpers that swap inline attachments for FileID
//! references when payload size makes that worthwhile.
//!
//! Most jfc workflows go through the existing `provider.rs` abstraction
//! (which talks the Anthropic Messages API directly via reqwest). This
//! module is for the *managed-agents* / *files* / *batches* / *skills*
//! surfaces — features that v132 has but jfc-ui's main streaming path
//! doesn't need.
