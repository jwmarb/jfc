//! Heuristic intent classification gate.
//!
//! Classifies user messages into intent categories using keyword/pattern
//! matching. No LLM round-trip — must complete in <5ms.
//!
//! # Auto graph-context injection
//!
//! When a prompt classifies as a graph-flavored intent ([`Intent::ImpactAnalysis`],
//! [`Intent::EntrypointDiscovery`], [`Intent::RefactorRisk`],
//! [`Intent::DependencyTrace`]) the [`auto_inject_graph_context`] helper runs
//! a cheap structural query against the workspace `GraphSession` and appends
//! the result as a `<system-reminder>` block on the user's turn. This
//! "frontloads" structural context the model would otherwise have to ask
//! for via `graph_query` — and frequently forgets to ask for at all.
//!
//! Disable by setting `JFC_GRAPH_AUTO_CONTEXT=0` in the environment. Default
//! is enabled. The check is per-call so users can flip the flag mid-session
//! without restarting.
//!
//! Cache: a process-local `OnceLock<Mutex<HashMap<PathBuf, Arc<GraphSession>>>>`
//! mirrors the cache in [`crate::tools`] but is independent — by design, the
//! injection path must not reach into the tool dispatcher's internals. The
//! first prompt per workspace pays the indexing cost; subsequent prompts hit
//! the cache. We deliberately do *not* invalidate this cache on edits because
//! the auto-context is "best-effort hint" not "ground truth" — a slightly
//! stale graph beats a slow first-render in the hot path.
