//! Synthetic PQRST trace generator for the sidebar network monitor.
//!
//! A real EKG has five named features per heartbeat — P, Q, R, S, T —
//! that map to the depolarization / repolarization phases of the
//! cardiac cycle. We model them as a 14-sample beat at 80ms/tick
//! (~52 BPM, comfortably resting-range), with the R wave's amplitude
//! scaling with recent network activity.
//!
//! Pattern derivation (from NeuroKit2 `ecg_simulate.py` and `signalz`
//! `ecgsyn`): the canonical PQRST extrema are roughly
//!   P: amp +1.2, Q: amp −5, R: amp +30, S: amp −7.5, T: amp +0.75.
//! Q and S are *negative* deflections — they dip below the
//! isoelectric line. To represent that in a 1-row block-element
//! sparkline (which has no "below zero" cell), we lift the
//! isoelectric baseline up to 2 so Q and S can drop to 0 and still
//! read as undershoots.
//!
