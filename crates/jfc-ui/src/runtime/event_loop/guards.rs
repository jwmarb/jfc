/// Borrow the message currently slated as the streaming-assistant target —

///
///   * No stream is in progress (`streaming_assistant_idx` is None).
///   * The stored index is out of bounds (a destructive op truncated past it).
///   * The slot a previous destructive op left behind is now a `Role::User`
///     or other non-assistant message.
///
/// The third case is the safety net for bugs like Up-arrow recall removing
/// a queued user message that sits before the active streaming assistant:
/// the remove shifts later indices down by one, and without an adjustment
/// `streaming_assistant_idx` points one slot to the left — at a user
/// placeholder. Routing every push through this helper means a stale index
/// drops the part with a `warn!` instead of silently corrupting the wire
/// shape (the API then rejects the next request with "tool_use blocks can
/// only appear in assistant messages").
