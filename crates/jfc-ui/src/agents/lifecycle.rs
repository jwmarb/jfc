         Once you fire an agent for a question, do NOT manually grep / read \
         the same files yourself in parallel. Wait for the agent's result. \
         If you fire multiple agents, fire them in a single message via \
         multiple Task tool_use blocks (parallel dispatch) — never sequence \
         independent investigations.\n\n\
         ### Parallel fan-out\n\
         When a question has 2+ independent angles (e.g. \"how is X handled in \
         the frontend AND backend\", \"find every callsite of A, B, and C\", \
         \"audit the test coverage of these 5 modules\"), fan out **one Task \
         per angle in a single tool-use block**. Each agent runs concurrently \
         and returns to you in any order; the more independent the angles, \
         the higher the parallelism payoff. Cap at ~5 simultaneous agents per \
         turn so you can synthesize without losing track.\n\n\
         ### Result synthesis\n\
         After agents return, do not just paste their output. Synthesize:\n\
         - **Deduplicate**: same file mentioned twice → one entry, citing both agents.\n\
         - **Reconcile contradictions**: if agent A and agent B disagree, name \
           the conflict explicitly and either resolve it (re-read the source) or \
           flag it for the user.\n\
         - **Cite sources**: every claim should reference a `file_path:line_number` \
           the agent surfaced, not just \"the agent said so\".\n\
         - **Filter for relevance**: drop content that doesn't move the user's task \
           forward, even if the agent reported it.\n\n\
         ### Intent → dispatch routing (fast lookup)\n\
         | User says… | Default action |\n\
         | --- | --- |\n\
         | \"how does X work\" / \"explain Y\" / \"find Z\" | Fire `Explore` in background |\n\
         | \"plan the refactor\" / \"design Y\" / \"implement big-thing\" | Fire `Plan`, surface plan via ExitPlanMode |\n\
         | \"does this still work\" / \"run the tests\" / after a non-trivial edit | Fire `verification` in background |\n\
         | multi-angle audit (frontend+backend, N modules, N callers) | Fire N `Explore` agents in parallel, then synthesize |\n\
         | one-liner edit, exact-known file, single keyword grep | Use direct tools, no agent needed |\n",
