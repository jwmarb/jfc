//! Faithfulness guard: detect when assistant prose claims a side
//! effect that isn't backed by a matching tool call.
//!
//! ## Research grounding
//!
//! This module implements a lightweight runtime variant of what the
//! agentic-LLM literature calls **faithfulness assurance** and
//! **outcome-evidence verification**. Two papers shaped the design:
//!
//! - *Replayable Financial Agents: A Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance
//!   Harness for Tool-Using LLM Agents* (Khatchadourian, arXiv:
//!   2601.15322) — formalizes faithfulness as "the agent's reported
//!   actions match the actions actually executed by its tools."
//!
//! - *Can Agent Benchmarks Support Their Scores? Evidence-Supported
//!   Bounds for Interactive-Agent Evaluation* (Gao & Zhou, arXiv:
//!   2605.10448) — argues that outcome checks need a **locked checklist
//!   of required stored artifacts** and a **three-state output** (Pass /
//!   Fail / **Unknown**) rather than binary success. Hiding Unknown
//!   cases inside aggregate scores produces misleading reports; we
//!   adopt the same trichotomy at runtime.
//!
//! ## Design v2 (improvements over v1)
//!
//! v1 was a flat phrase list with a binary backed/unbacked output. It
//! flagged "I wrote down the plan" (a legitimate self-reference) the
//! same as "I wrote the file" (a side-effect claim). v2 distinguishes:
//!
//! 1. **Claim categories**: each phrase maps to a category
//!    (`WroteFile`, `RanCommand`, `Deployed`, `SentMessage`,
//!    `EditedCode`, `Committed`, `Pushed`, `Generic`).
//! 2. **Per-category backing tools**: each category has an explicit
//!    allow-list of `ToolKind`s that satisfy it. A `Write` backs
//!    `WroteFile` but not `Committed`; a `Bash` backs `RanCommand` and
//!    `Committed` and `Pushed` (since git commands run via Bash).
//! 3. **Three-state verdict**: `Backed` (claim → tool match found),
//!    `Unbacked` (claim found, no satisfying tool), `Ambiguous` (claim
//!    found, OR'd backing tool present in turn AND a "scratch"
//!    qualifier like "I wrote down" / "I noted" appears near the
//!    phrase).
//! 4. **Conservative trigger**: only `Unbacked` re-runs the turn.
//!    `Ambiguous` surfaces a quieter info toast and lets the turn
//!    finalize — research literature explicitly warns that hiding
//!    Unknown cases produces worse outcomes than logging them.
//!
//! ## Negative-list qualifiers (anti-false-positive)
//!
//! Several phrases would false-positive on v1. v2 strips them from the
//! match space:
//!
//! - "I wrote down" / "I noted" / "I jotted" — scratchpad reference
//! - "wrote the plan" / "wrote the steps" / "wrote a TaskCreate" —
//!   model describing its own planning output, not file I/O
//! - "wrote that the / wrote that …" — quoted speech about what the
//!   user wrote
//! - "I've already" / "previously" — referring to past turns where
//!   the action DID happen and the artifact is in history
//!
//! ## Disable
//!
//! `JFC_DISABLE_HALLUCINATION_GUARD=1` turns the whole guard off.
//! `JFC_HALLUCINATION_GUARD_LOG_ONLY=1` keeps detection running but
//! never re-runs the turn (logs + toast only) — useful for tuning the
//! pattern set against real workloads without disrupting the user.
