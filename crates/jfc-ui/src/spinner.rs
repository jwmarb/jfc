//! v126-style "Fermenting…" spinner state.
//!
//! Mirrors the architecture from `cli.js` lines 233823-234022 (verb list)
//! and 322930-323289 (frame cycle, stall thresholds, "almost done thinking"
//! trigger). Pure formatting — the renderer reads `App` fields and calls
//! into here; no mutation, no I/O.
//!
//! ## Pieces
//!
//! - **Frames**: 6-char cycle `[· ✢ * ✶ ✻ ✽]` (matches v126's default
//!   spinner; ghostty variant unused here for simplicity).
//! - **Verbs**: a 32-entry subset of v126's 177-verb list, picked by hash
//!   of `frame_seed` so the verb is **stable for runs of the same seed**.
//!   v126 randomizes per-render which feels chaotic in a TUI; we rotate
//!   every ~2s instead by deriving the seed from `(elapsed.as_secs() / 2)`.
//! - **Sub-status**: `almost done thinking` appears when **>=60s** has
//!   passed since the last token (matches v126 `VW_=60s`, line 323283).
//!
//! ## Format (one line)
//!
//! ```text
//! * Fermenting… (5m 10s · ↓ 14.6k tokens · almost done thinking)
//! ```
